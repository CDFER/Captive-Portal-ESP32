# ESP Cross Platform Captive Portal
A ESP32 Captive Portal that actually works on all devices (or that is the goal).


I need you help! If you test this code on a device (even if it works)
Fill out the form here: https://forms.gle/ArLPTnwRA3QGTKyc6

A list of all tested devices can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1588-0fG21-aaR2pWJNQjufwgPaIDbHX_0geHEn1yDHk/edit?usp=sharing


Known Limitations at the moment:
---------------
- Firefox gives a warning page about going to a non-https page
- Oneplus 6 (Oxygen OS 11) sometimes doesn't connect of first try but does on the second
