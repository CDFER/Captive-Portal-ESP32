# ESP32 Cross Platform Captive Portal Example

A ESP32 Captive Portal (think airport wifi sign in page) example that works on all devices (or that's the goal).

When you connect to the wifi "captive" password "12345678" it should take you straight to http://4.3.2.1/ and display some simple text.

## Quickstart with ESP Home Flasher tool on Windows, MacOS and Linux

This is a simple GUI-based tool that can be downloaded from here: https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases/

If running Windows, you will most likely need a driver from here: https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/ch340_driver.html before your computer will show the COM port in ESPhome Flasher.


## Did it work?
If you test this code on a device (even if it works) it would be really helpful if you fill out the form here: https://forms.gle/ArLPTnwRA3QGTKyc6



## Known Bugs with current version
- Oneplus 6 phone (Oxygen OS 11) sometimes gets stuck on setting client side IP address when cellular is on


### Further testing required
- If you have a lot of tabs open in Windows 11 (and probably other desktop OS) it increases the load on the ESP32 DNS server.
- HTML Webpage being served multiple times


### Future Dev Options to look into (Help or suggestions are appreciated):
- Set client DHCP IP address range in private space (currently clients much accept to use 4.3.2.2 as their ip)
- Support integrating the DHCP or IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) options for Captive Portals on iOS 14+ and macOS Big Sur+ https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=q78sq5rv
