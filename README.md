- Lots of comments that explain how it all works

## üñºÔ∏è User interface
![User interface](/images/banner.jpg)

## üì≤ Quickstart with ESP Home Flasher tool on Windows, MacOS and Linux

This is a simple all in one GUI tool that can be downloaded from here: <https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases/>

Download the firmware from the releases page and chuck it in select the serial port from the dropdown and press flash ESP

If running Windows , you will most likely need a driver from here: <https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/ch340_driver.html> before your computer will show the ESP32 com port in the drop down menu in ESPhome Flasher.

### Compile yourself using PlatformIO

- Make sure Git client is installed on your system. https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
- Download and install Visual Studio Code by Microsoft. https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Open Visual Studio Code and go to the Extensions manager (the icon with the stacked blocks in the left bar)
- Search for platformio and install the PlatformIO extension
- Download the source code by running a git clone (git gui can be found in your right click menu) with the link: https://github.com/CDFER/Captive-Portal-ESP32.git in your projects folder.
- In VS Code Go to File -> Open Folder and open that root folder (the one that contains platformio.ini, NOT the src folder)
- Upload to the esp32 using the right arrow button in the bottom left corner of vs code (it takes awhile for the first compile)

### Did it work?

If you test this code on a device (even if it works) it would be really helpful if you fill out the form here: <https://forms.gle/ArLPTnwRA3QGTKyc6>


## Known Bugs/limitations with current version

- Oneplus 6 phone (Oxygen OS 11) sometimes gets stuck on setting client side IP address when cellular is on
- On older devices you may need to open a web browser for it to display
- max of 4 clients connected at the same time
- MacOS post macOS Big Sur no pop up


### Further testing required

- If you have a lot of tabs open in Windows 11 (and probably other OS) it increases the load on the ESP32 DNS server.
- HTML Webpage being served multiple times
- Other ESP32 chip variants (all testing so far is on the ESP32 D0WDQ6 chip in the ESP32S module)
- Test increasing the max clients connected up from 4 to max supported 10


### Future Dev Options to look into (Help or suggestions are appreciated):

- Set client DHCP IP address range in private space (currently clients must accept DHCP Server Range: 4.3.2.2 to 4.3.2.12)
- Support integrating the DHCP or IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) options for Captive Portals on iOS 14+ and macOS Big Sur+ https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=q78sq5rv
- Port https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED-WebInstaller

This work was done as part of a project with Simon Ingram of Terrestrial Assemblages with the support of Govett-Brewster Art Gallery / Len Lye Centre

Thanks to @me-no-dev and everyone at @Espressif Systems for making a really awesome chip and porting it to arduino

Thanks to @LTRTNZ and @vincentd123 for putting up with my never ending shit and @Vincent for helping me through this crazy year


[^1]: devices from the last 10 years, or that's the goal of this project :)
